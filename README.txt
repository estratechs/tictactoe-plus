Optional helpers (safe to adopt gradually):

- package.json: adds helpful scripts and Node engine hint (won't affect runtime if you keep your own).
- index.css additions: accessibility & reduced-motion helpers (pure CSS).

How to use:
  • If you *already* have package.json, compare and copy over only what you want.
  • Append the CSS block to your existing src/index.css (or wherever your global styles live).
